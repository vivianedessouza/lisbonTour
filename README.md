# Site

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
 
# Running WebService
To run the webservice/APIs, you need go to the folder webservice and run the `nodemon` or npm start, to startup the nodejs. You can access through the address `http://localhost:4000`. 
There are two API implemented: GET `/api/attractions` (to list all available attractions and POST `/api/attractions` (To make the reservation).
For this phase, I'm not using the database to storage the data.
